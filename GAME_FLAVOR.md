## CYKO CITY

POVERTY and STRIFE rule the festering streets of THE CITY. Daylight weakly pierces the smog of cancerous industry as the wretched inhabitants scratch out a meager living in the sludge and grime.
Many turn to lives of crime, killing and robbing to keep food on the table -- and drugs in the bloodstream. When night falls, the streets become the neon-cast battleground for those brave or stupid
enough to heed the deadly call. Many fight for scraps, but the true lords of the night are the CYKO GANGS, consortiums of youths, hoodlumns, and the dispossesed. They ply the night on their trusty steeds - 
souped-up (and probably stoled) CYKO bikes - hopped up on nitro and capable of terrifying speed, the bikes are their life and livelyhood. 

The CYKO GANGS clash frequently over territory, each seeking to expand their enterprises (selling drugs, theft, and extortion) and their prestige, so that they might attract the fastest on the streets and become - LORDS OF THE NIGHT. 



TODOS:
tapping directions still causes lots of drift - momentum of bike should scale with speed/length of input
